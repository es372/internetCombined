                    <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
                    <p>IP (Internetworking Protocol) Address is an address assigned to a specific computer that can access the internet. It helps in connecting your
                        computer to other devices on your network and all over the world. An IP Address is made up of numbers or characters.</p>
                    <p>An example of an IP address would be: 506.457.14.512</p>
                    <p>There are are two IP versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older version which has space of over 4 billion IP addresses. However, the new
                        IPv6 version can provide up to undecillions of IP addresses to fulfill the need of all internet users and devices.</p>
                    <p>All devices that are connected to an internet connection have a unique IP address which means there’s a need of billions of IP addresses.
                        This requirement is fulfilled by the new IP version IPv6.</p>
                    <p>Example of an IPv6 IP address would be: 4ggr:1925:5656:7:600:t4tt:tc54:98vt</p>

                    <h3>Packets</h3>
                    <p>It turns out that everything you do on the Internet involves packets. On the Internet, the network breaks down data into parts of a
                        certain size in bytes. These are the packets. Each packet carries the information that will help it get to its destination, the sender's IP
                        address tells the intended receiver's IP address how many packets this e-mail message has been broken into and the number of these particular packets.
                    </p>
                    <p>The packets carry the data in the protocols that the Internet uses, which is known as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</p>

                    <h3>Routing</h3>
                    <p>The whole world is digitalized and connected over the network. Packets, are exchanged between end devices that contain an IP adress.
                        The process of transferring these packets of information from their source to the destination end device with one or more hops in between
                        the most optimum path is called as ‘Routing’. Routers and switches are the instruments that are used for the purpose which work on the
                        routing protocols and algorithms they are configured with.
                    </p>
                    <p>When a packet is introduced in the network and received by one of the routers, it reads the headers of the packet to understand the destination
                        Then, it pushes the packet to the next end device and the above process repeats at the end device until the packet reaches its destination IP address.
