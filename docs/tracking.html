                <h3>What is Internet Tracking?</h3>
                <p>
                    We’ve noticed a problem on the internet, and if you’ve been paying attention, you’ve probably noticed too. The majority of the websites you visit
                    are tracking you. They are collecting information about where you are, who you are, and what you’re doing on their websites. Generally, tracking
                    involves collecting information about your use of or interaction with a particular web page. Web trackers can collect more information than just
                    your browsing of a website. Websites also use them to collect your personal information: your IP address, where you came from, your geographic
                    location and your browser characteristics.

                <h3>How Does Online Tracking Work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The websites that track you use three main methods: cookies, fingerprinting, and beacons. Websites may identify you with your login credentials,
                    unique device identifiers or your IP address. Once a site determines your identity, it then assembles all the information it collects about you in
                    a data profile.
                    <br><br>
                    Cookies are small files stored in your browser that help websites you visit often identify you. Websites use cookies to store your custom settings
                    and preferences or log-in information. Cookies can add convenience to the sites you visit often, but unfortunately websites also use them to store
                    your data.
                    <br><br>
                    Tracking beacons are small, transparent “images” often 1 pixel by 1 pixel, that load on on web pages (or within emails) for tracking and reporting
                    purposes. Websites use beacons to get information about how many times visitors load certain pages. Advertisers also use these tracking beacons to
                    determine how many impressions their ads get.
                    <br><br>
                    Fingerprinting is a more complex tracking method. Rather than storing a file in your browser or on your computer to identify you, it’s done by checking your browser configurations and settings.
                    The methods of fingerprinting are always growing more complex. Other factors that are used to identify you could be your browser version, monitor size and resolution, or operating system.

                <h3>The Problem With Tracking on the Internet</h3>
                <p>
                    We see a big issue with the ways websites track their users. There are ways that websites could anonymize their tracking data, but not all do.
                    If every website you visit is tracking you, it creates a culture that accepts tracking. By growing indifferent to sharing our information with
                    third-parties, we risk losing control of our private data completely. Too much tracking shifts power away from consumers and towards
                    advertisers who wish to influence customer purchasing behavior.
