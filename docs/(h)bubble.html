                <h3>The Dilemma</h3>
                <p>
                    Facebook's success at connecting the world has come at a very high cost. In the old days before the internet, people would get their information
                    from reputable print and broadcast media that was actually curated and edited. Now the vast majority get the news from a website that takes almost
                    no responsibility for what it spews into the world. The dark side of unlimited access soon manifested itself, as the site was exploited by
                    nefarious forces to create divisiveness and spread misinformation (you may know the latter as "fake news").

                <h3>Facebook's Issue</h3>
                <p>
                    Even while company executives were publicly talking about how Facebook valued and aimed to protect its users' privacy, they were figuring new ways
                    to monetize the personal data they were collecting. The pressure for profitability became particularly intense during the period leading up to the
                    company going public.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, the Defense Department became increasingly worried about the security lapses inherent in social media that allowed it to be weaponized.
                    And it had good reason to be concerned, with Russia and other countries increasingly using it for their own purposes. A good amount of the
                    disinformation, which included a news story about the Pope endorsing then-presidential candidate Donald Trump that went viral, emanated from, of
                    all places, Macedonia. Things only became worse in the lead-up to the 2016 election with the proliferation of hyper-partisan Facebook pages. "The
                    very things that divide us most cause the most engagement," an analyst points out. After Trump was elected, Zuckerberg proclaimed that Facebook
                    didn't have any impact on the election. Later, of course, he announced that political-oriented disinformation had been traced to sources linked
                    with the Russian government.
