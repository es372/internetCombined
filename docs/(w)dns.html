                        According to a Pew study, 86% of Americans have taken action to maintain their privacy — deleting cookies, encrypting email, and
                        protecting their IP address.

                <p>The whole world is digitalized and connected over the network. Packets, are exchanged between end devices that contain an IP adress.
                    The process of transferring these packets of information from their source to the destination end device with one or more hops in between
                    the most optimum path is called as ‘Routing’. Routers and switches are the instruments that are used for the purpose which work on the
                    routing protocols and algorithms they are configured with.
                </p>
                <p>When a packet is introduced in the network and received by one of the routers, it reads the headers of the packet to understand the destination
                    Then, it pushes the packet to the next end device and the above process repeats at the end device until the packet reaches its destination IP address.
